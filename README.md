Project Title: Fornova_Home_Task

Overview
This project involves analyzing hotel pricing data from a JSON file (Python-task.json). 

The primary objectives are to:
(i)     Find the lowest price for hotel rooms.
(ii)   Identify the room type and number of guests for the cheapest room.
(iii)  Calculate and display the total price (net price + taxes) for all room types.
The project is implemented in Python and involves JSON data parsing, data manipulation, and basic file operations.

File Description
Python-task.json: This JSON file contains hotel pricing data, including room types, prices, taxes, and other relevant hotel information.

Key Features
Lowest Price Finder: Determines the cheapest price among various hotel room offerings.
Room Details Extraction: Identifies the room type and accommodation capacity for the most affordable option.
Total Price Calculation: Computes the total cost for each room type, factoring in both the net price and applicable taxes.

Usage
To execute the project, run the Python script that includes the following functionalities:
Loading and parsing the Python-task.json file.
Iteratively searching through the data to find the lowest price and corresponding room details.
Calculating the total price for each room, including taxes.
Optionally, the results can be written to an output file for further analysis or reporting.

Requirements
Python 3.9
Access to the Python-task.json file.
Sample Code Description

The Python script consists of the following key components:
JSON Data Loading: Opens and reads the Python-task.json file.
Data Processing: Extracts and processes the necessary information from the JSON data.
Output Generation: Prints the results to the console.
